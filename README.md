# Summary
The development of this project involved a straightforward process that is reflected in the git commit history. First, the interfaces and classes were added with the methods and members that directly matched project requirements, along with documentation that describes the purpose of each class or method. Then, each implementation was committed separately along with any additional members added to help drive implementation. Normally this would be done on a per-member basis, but these classes were small enough to warrant committing for each class. Any additional documentation or helpful comments to explain some of the more complex snippets of code were added. Finally, after any helper methods or overrides were introduced, a main class is added to test the functionality of each class, including any edge cases to test for.
